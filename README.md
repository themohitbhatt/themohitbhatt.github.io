# themohitbhatt.github.io

This is a simple app that allows users to ride a bicycle from one place in the campus to another. 

The user can select the location and destination and generate OTP for unlocking the bicycles integrated with IoT (this feature has not been implemented, it's just an idea for upscaling the app). 

To clone the repository, type "git clone https://github.com/themohitbhatt/themohitbhatt.github.io" in terminal.
